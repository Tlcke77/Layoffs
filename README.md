## Business Task

## üßº Data Cleaning & Transformation

### Step 1: Create a Staging Table
````sql
CREATE TABLE layoff_staging
LIKE layoffs
;
`````
THEN
````sql
INSERT layoff_staging
SELECT *
FROM layoffs
;
`````

### Step 2: Remove Duplicates

- First we need to identify possivle duplicates within the dataset. This can be done by assiging each entry a `row_number`.
````sql
WITH dublicate_cte AS
(
SELECT *, 
row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised) AS row_num
FROM layoff_staging
)
SELECT *
FROM dublicate_cte
WHERE row_num > 1
;
`````
- We have identified two potential companies Beyond Meat and Cazoo

- Next, we can furhter this by looking into the entries into this dataset for each of the companies to determine their status as a dublicate.
  - Cazoo
    ````sql
    SELECT *
    FROM layoff_staging
    WHERE company = 'Cazoo'
    ;
    `````
      - A dublicate is confirmed here found in the last two rows.
      - PICTURE\

  - Beyond Meat
   ````sql
    SELECT *
    FROM layoff_staging
    WHERE company = 'Cazoo'
    ;
    `````
     - A dublicate is confirmed here found in the sencond row.
      - PICTURE\

- Further, we'll create another Staging table so we can filer on the row_num
````sql
    CREATE TABLE `layoff_staging` (
  `company` text,
  `location` text,
  `industry` text,
  `total_laid_off` text,
  `percentage_laid_off` text,
  `date` text,
  `stage` text,
  `country` text,
  `funds_raised` text,
  `row_num` INT -- Add row_num
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
`````

````sql
  INSERT INTO layoff_staging2
  SELECT *, 
  row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised) AS row_num
  FROM layoff_staging
  ;
`````

- Finally, we can delete the dublicate rows
````sql
DELETE
FROM layoff_staging2
WHERE row_num > 1
;
`````

### Step 3: Standardize the data

- At first glance I noticed that some of the spacing is off in the company names so I applied a `trim` to take off the whitespace off.
````sql
SELECT company, TRIM(company)
FROM layoff_staging2
;
`````
- PICTURE

- Apply trim
````sql
UPDATE layoff_staging2
SET company = TRIM(company)
;
`````
-Next, I reviewed the company‚Äôs location data and identified errors related to diacritics‚Äîspecial accent marks used in many languages (like √©, √±, √º) that change how letters are pronounced or understood. For example, in the dataset, the city of "D√ºsseldorf" appeared incorrectly as "D√É¬ºsseldorf." Below are the errors I identified and corrected along with the respective SQL queries.

  - D√É¬ºsseldorf -> D√ºsseldorf
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'D√ºsseldorf'
  WHERE location = 'D√É¬ºsseldorf'
  ;
  `````
 - F√É¬∏rde -> F√òRDE
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'F√òRDE'
  WHERE location = 'F√É¬∏rde'
  ;
  `````
 - Florian√É¬≥polis -> Florian√≥polis
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'F√òRDE'
  WHERE location = 'F√É¬∏rde'
  ;
  `````
- Malm√É¬∂ -> Malm√∂ 
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'Malm√∂'
  WHERE location = 'Malm√É¬∂'
  ;
  `````
- Wroc√Ö‚Äöaw -> Wroc≈Çaw 
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'Malm√∂'
  WHERE location = 'Malm√É¬∂'
  ;
  `````
- Another similar issue was found in the country column, where some rows used "UAE" while others used "United Arab Emirates." I will standardize the data to use the full spelling instead of the abbreviation for consistency.
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET country = 'United Arab Emirates'
  WHERE country = 'UAE'
  ;
  `````
  
- I will change the data column from text to a date format to enable time series data analysis.
  ````sql
  ALTER TABLE layoff_staging2
  MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE
  ;
  `````


### Step 4: Null Values or blank values
### Step 5: Remove Any Columns
