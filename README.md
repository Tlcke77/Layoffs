## About the Dataset

This project uses a dataset that tracks recent tech layoffs, sourced from platforms like Bloomberg, San Francisco Business Times, TechCrunch, and The New York Times. 

## üßº Data Cleaning & Transformation

### Step 1: Create a Staging Table
````sql
CREATE TABLE layoff_staging
LIKE layoffs
;
`````
THEN
````sql
INSERT layoff_staging
SELECT *
FROM layoffs
;
`````

### Step 2: Remove Duplicates

- First we need to identify possible duplicates within the dataset. This can be done by assigning each entry a `row_number`.
````sql
WITH duplicate_cte AS
(
SELECT *, 
row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised) AS row_num
FROM layoff_staging
)
SELECT *
FROM duplicate_cte
WHERE row_num > 1
;
`````
- We have identified two potential companies Beyond Meat and Cazoo

- Next, we can further this by looking into the entries into this dataset for each of the companies to determine their status as a duplicate.
  - Cazoo
    ````sql
    SELECT *
    FROM layoff_staging
    WHERE company = 'Cazoo'
    ;
    `````
      - A duplicate is confirmed here found in the last two rows.

  - Beyond Meat
````sql
SELECT *
FROM layoff_staging
WHERE company = 'Cazoo'
;
````
- A duplicate is confirmed here found in the sencond row.

- Further, we'll create another staging table so we can filter on the row_num
````sql
  CREATE TABLE `layoff_staging` (
  `company` text,
  `location` text,
  `industry` text,
  `total_laid_off` text,
  `percentage_laid_off` text,
  `date` text,
  `stage` text,
  `country` text,
  `funds_raised` text,
  `row_num` INT -- Add row_num
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
````

````sql
  INSERT INTO layoff_staging2
  SELECT *, 
  row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised) AS row_num
  FROM layoff_staging
  ;
````

- Finally, we can delete the duplicate rows
````sql
DELETE
FROM layoff_staging2
WHERE row_num > 1
;
````

### Step 3: Standardize the data

- At first glance I noticed that some of the spacing is off in the company names so I applied a `trim` to take off the whitespace off.
````sql
SELECT company, TRIM(company)
FROM layoff_staging2
;
`````
<img src="https://github.com/Tlcke77/pics/blob/main/Capture%204.PNG" alt="Image" width="188" height="136">

- Apply trim
````sql
UPDATE layoff_staging2
SET company = TRIM(company)
;
`````
-Next, I reviewed the company‚Äôs location data and identified errors related to diacritics‚Äîspecial accent marks used in many languages (like √©, √±, √º) that change how letters are pronounced or understood. For example, in the dataset, the city of "D√ºsseldorf" appeared incorrectly as "D√É¬ºsseldorf." Below are the errors I identified and corrected along with the respective SQL queries.

  - D√É¬ºsseldorf -> D√ºsseldorf
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'D√ºsseldorf'
  WHERE location = 'D√É¬ºsseldorf'
  ;
  `````
 - F√É¬∏rde -> F√òRDE
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'F√òRDE'
  WHERE location = 'F√É¬∏rde'
  ;
  `````
 - Florian√É¬≥polis -> Florian√≥polis
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'F√òRDE'
  WHERE location = 'F√É¬∏rde'
  ;
  `````
- Malm√É¬∂ -> Malm√∂ 
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'Malm√∂'
  WHERE location = 'Malm√É¬∂'
  ;
  `````
- Wroc√Ö‚Äöaw -> Wroc≈Çaw 
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'Malm√∂'
  WHERE location = 'Malm√É¬∂'
  ;
  `````
- Another similar issue was found in the country column, where some rows used "UAE" while others used "United Arab Emirates." I will standardize the data to use the full spelling instead of the abbreviation for consistency.
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET country = 'United Arab Emirates'
  WHERE country = 'UAE'
  ;
  `````
  
- I will change the data column from text to a date format to enable time series data analysis.
  ````sql
  ALTER TABLE layoff_staging2
  MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE
  ;
  `````

### Step 4: Null Values or Blank Values

- The blank space I looked at where in the Industry column and here I indentified one blank value. It was with the company called "Appsmith". Out of the available industry options used in the dataset I felt that it fell best under the 'Other' category.
  ````sql
  SELECT *
  FROM layoff_staging2
  WHERE industry IS NULL 
  OR industry = ''
  ;
  `````

  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET industry = 'Other'
  WHERE industry = ''
  ;
  ````` 
- Then I looked at the location column and found a blank column for the company "Product Hunt".
  ````sql
  SELECT *
  FROM layoff_staging2
  WHERE location IS NULL 
  OR location = ''
  ;
  `````
  
  ````sql
  UPDATE layoff_staging2
  SET location = 'SF Bay Area'
  WHERE location = ''
  ;
  `````
:grey_exclamation: Discalmier there is still some blank values in the total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, stage, and funds_raised because I fell like its not possible to populate the values with data due to the data availbe with the dataset. :grey_exclamation:

### Step 5: Remove Any Columns

:grey_exclamation: This section is completely option and is based on your goal for the dataset. :grey_exclamation:

- I'm cleaning this dateset with the goal of performing some exploaratory data analaysis. So with that said I will be removing columns where total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off are blank becuase they service no additonal value to me in my future process with my future data analysis.
  
 ````sql
  DELETE
  FROM layoff_staging2
  WHERE percentage_laid_off = ''
  AND total_laid_off = ''
  ;
  `````

- Then I no longer need the row_num column as well.
 ````sql
  ALTER TABLE layoff_staging2
  DROP COLUMN row_num
  ;
  `````
